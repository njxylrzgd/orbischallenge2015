        First step of any turn is to refresh the values of each tile on the board.

        2. Check for bullets in your two tiles proximity S
        3. Avoid getting shot by turrets S
        4. Check for power ups nearby
        4. Look if you can get in the line of sight of a turret
        5. See if power up available/necessary
